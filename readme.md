## Subscription API example

In this project I am showcasing a simple subscription api, allowing to perform typical tasks connected with operating
 a subscription based company ;).

## Project information

I decided to use Laravel as the basis for the API, as it is the framework I am most familiar with at the moment and
I did not want to be too time constrained due to too many new things. Modifying it to be more DDD like was probably
the greatest challenge in this task - due to little practical knowledge of it. As I have found, there is no perfect
way of combining Laravel with DDD, albeit even taking it into consideration, allows to make more conscious choices
while constructing your application - and that is for me the immediate benefit of this task.
